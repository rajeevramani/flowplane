## Phase 1: Two-Path API Architecture ðŸŽ¯ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Goal**: Establish clear separation between Native (Advanced) API for platform engineers and unified Platform API for API developers, with consistent resource views across both paths.

### API Architecture Restructuring (Critical)
- [ ] **Native/Advanced API** (`/api/v1/native/*`)
  - Direct Envoy configuration access for platform engineers
  - Full control over listeners, routes, clusters, filters
  - Uses existing Envoy terminology and concepts
  - Team isolation enforced for multi-tenancy

- [ ] **Unified Platform API** (`/api/v1/platform/*`)
  - Developer-friendly abstraction layer
  - **MOVE existing OpenAPI import from `/api/v1/gateway/import` to `/api/v1/platform/import/openapi`**
  - Merge Platform API capabilities with OpenAPI import (single codebase, not duplicate)
  - Resource terminology mapping:
    - APIs â†’ Routes/Virtual Hosts
    - Endpoints â†’ Clusters/Upstreams
    - Services â†’ Listeners
  - OpenAPI import endpoint: `/api/v1/platform/import/openapi` (relocated from gateway)
  - API definition management: `/api/v1/platform/apis/*`

### OpenAPI Extension Support
- [ ] **Custom Filter Tags**
  - Support `x-flowplane-` prefixed extensions in OpenAPI specs
  - Pre-defined filters: `x-flowplane-ratelimit`, `x-flowplane-jwt-auth`, `x-flowplane-cors`
  - Filter configuration embedded in OpenAPI extensions
  - Validation and error reporting for unsupported filters

### Filter Injection Hierarchy
- [ ] **Multi-Level Filter Application**
  - Route-level filters (highest precedence)
  - Route-config-level filters
  - Listener-level filters
  - Filters applied as specified, let Envoy handle composition
  - Store filter configs embedded in resource JSON

### Data Transformation Layer
- [ ] **Direct Transformation Approach**
  - Platform API â†’ Envoy entities using existing `/src/xds/*` code
  - Leverage existing `PathMatch`, `RouteConfig` types as common models
  - Path pattern automatic conversion:
    - `/api/v1/resource` â†’ prefix match
    - `/api/v1/resource/{id}` â†’ template match
    - `/api/v1/resource/*/details` â†’ regex match

---

## Phase 2: Data Model Unification & Consistency ðŸ”§ **CRITICAL**

**Goal**: Ensure unified resource views and prevent configuration loss across API paths. This remains high priority as specified in the unified cluster model spec.

### Unified Cluster Model Implementation
- [ ] **ClusterConfigV2** - As specified in `2025-10-02-unified-cluster-model` spec
  - Versioned serialization for all cluster configs
  - Field preservation across API updates
  - Automatic v1â†’v2 migration
  - Rollback safety with audit trail

### Resource Query Consistency
- [ ] **Unified View Implementation**
  - All resources (listeners, routes, clusters, filters) queryable from both APIs
  - Consistent state regardless of creation method
  - Platform API resources visible in Native API queries
  - Native API resources manageable via Platform API where appropriate

### Storage Normalization
- [ ] **Route Storage Unification**
  - Ensure all routes stored in `routes` table
  - Platform API routes materialized properly
  - Foreign key constraints maintained

### Cross-Path Integration Tests
- [ ] **Comprehensive Test Suite**
  - Create via Native â†’ Update via Platform â†’ Verify consistency
  - Import OpenAPI â†’ Query Native API â†’ Verify visibility
  - Update cluster â†’ Verify route resolution across APIs
  - Filter preservation across API boundaries

### Team Isolation Enhancement
- [ ] **Enforced Team Boundaries**
  - Team isolation applied to both Native and Platform APIs
  - Platform engineers manage resources within team scope
  - No bypass for team boundaries (security requirement)

### RBAC Implementation
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control**
  - Roles: admin, platform-engineer, api-developer
  - Permissions scoped to teams and API paths
  - Token scopes aligned with roles

### Resource Quotas
- [ ] **Per-Team Limits**
  - Quotas for clusters, routes, listeners, API definitions
  - Rate limiting per team token
  - Storage quota enforcement

## Notes

- **Phase 1 & 2 are highest priority** - Two-path architecture and data consistency must be completed first
- **CRITICAL: OpenAPI import is MOVED, not duplicated** - Relocate existing `/api/v1/gateway/import` to `/api/v1/platform/import/openapi`
- No backward compatibility concerns - no existing customers, can remove old endpoint immediately
- Filter configuration embedded in resource JSON for simplicity
- Direct transformation approach using existing `/src/xds/*` code
- Platform API and OpenAPI import share same underlying implementation - unified codebase
