# Feature Specification: TLS Bring-Your-Own-Cert MVP

**Feature Branch**: `002-cp-tls-enable`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "TLS Bring-Your-Own-Cert MVP Spec

Goal Enable TLS termination on Flowplane admin/control APIs using externally supplied certificates without changing existing mTLS internals.
Deliverables
Config toggle (env var/CLI) to enable TLS; document expected file paths for PEM cert/key (and optional chain) plus validation/error messages.
Runtime wiring for TLS listener: load cert/key at startup, fail fast on missing/invalid files, log success, and expose reload command or documented restart requirement.
Non-TLS default remains unchanged; PAT + mTLS flows operate identically when TLS is off.
Docs: "Bring your own cert" guide covering ACME (certbot/docker-compose example), corporate PKI, self-signed for dev; include renewal checklist and troubleshooting.
Reference assets: sample config snippet, systemd/docker-compose template showing volume mounts and TLS toggle.
Tests: unit coverage for config parsing/validation, integration smoke test ensuring TLS endpoint serves a basic request with supplied files.
Out of Scope Embedded ACME automation, certificate rotation service, changes to existing mutual TLS between Envoy and CP."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Flowplane operator, I want to enable TLS termination on the control plane admin APIs using my own externally-provided certificates, so that I can secure HTTP traffic to the control plane with certificates from my organization's PKI or ACME providers while maintaining the existing mTLS security for xDS communication.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have valid PEM certificate and key files, **When** I configure TLS environment variables and start Flowplane, **Then** the admin API serves HTTPS requests using my certificates and logs successful TLS initialization
2. **Given** TLS is disabled (default), **When** I make API requests to the control plane, **Then** the system continues to work exactly as before with HTTP and existing authentication
3. **Given** I provide invalid or missing certificate files, **When** I start Flowplane with TLS enabled, **Then** the system fails fast at startup with clear error messages indicating which files are invalid or missing
4. **Given** TLS is enabled with valid certificates, **When** I make authenticated API requests over HTTPS, **Then** personal access token authentication works identically to the HTTP mode
5. **Given** I need to renew my certificates, **When** I replace the certificate files and restart Flowplane, **Then** the new certificates are loaded and TLS continues working without affecting authentication or xDS communication

### Edge Cases
- What happens when certificate files become unreadable during startup due to permissions?
- How does the system handle malformed PEM files or mismatched certificate/key pairs?
- What occurs when certificates expire while the service is running?
- How are mixed certificate chains (intermediate certificates) validated and loaded?
- What happens when TLS is enabled but certificate paths point to non-existent files?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support a configuration toggle (environment variable) to enable TLS termination on admin APIs without affecting existing mTLS xDS communication
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept PEM-formatted certificate file, private key file, and optional certificate chain file paths via configuration
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate certificate files at startup and fail fast with descriptive error messages for missing, unreadable, or malformed files
- **FR-004**: System MUST load and use provided certificates to serve HTTPS requests on the admin API endpoints when TLS is enabled
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain identical authentication behavior (personal access tokens) whether TLS is enabled or disabled
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve existing xDS mTLS functionality unchanged when admin API TLS is enabled
- **FR-007**: System MUST log successful TLS initialization including certificate details (subject, expiration) without exposing private key data
- **FR-008**: System MUST default to HTTP mode when TLS configuration is not provided, maintaining backward compatibility
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate certificate/key pair matching and reject mismatched pairs with clear error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST support certificate chain files for intermediate certificate authorities
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear documentation covering ACME (Let's Encrypt), corporate PKI, and self-signed certificate workflows
- **FR-012**: System MUST include operational guidance for certificate renewal, troubleshooting, and deployment patterns
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide reference configuration examples for Docker Compose and systemd deployments with volume mounts
- **FR-014**: System MUST require service restart for certificate changes (no hot reload requirement in MVP)
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate file permissions and accessibility for certificate files during startup
- **FR-016**: System MUST include comprehensive unit test coverage for configuration parsing and validation logic focusing on critical certificate validation paths
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide integration smoke tests that verify HTTPS endpoints serve basic requests with supplied certificate files

### Out of Scope (Deferred for Future Iterations)

The following capabilities are explicitly excluded from this MVP to maintain focused scope:

- **Embedded ACME automation**: Automatic certificate provisioning from Let's Encrypt or other ACME providers
- **Certificate rotation service**: Hot reloading or automatic renewal of certificates without service restart
- **Changes to existing mTLS**: Modifications to xDS mutual TLS communication between Envoy and control plane
- **Certificate discovery**: Automatic detection or retrieval of certificates from external certificate stores
- **Hot certificate reload**: Runtime certificate updates without service restart (restart required for MVP)
- **Client certificate authentication**: Certificate-based authentication for admin API (only server-side TLS termination)
- **Certificate monitoring service**: Built-in certificate expiration monitoring and alerting (manual monitoring required)

### Key Entities

- **TLS Configuration**: Represents the TLS enablement settings including certificate file paths, validation rules, and operational parameters
- **Certificate Bundle**: Represents the loaded certificate, private key, and optional chain files with validation status and metadata
- **Admin API Listener**: Represents the HTTP/HTTPS server that handles control plane API requests with optional TLS termination
- **Certificate Validator**: Represents the validation logic for PEM files, certificate/key matching, and chain verification

## Follow-Up Considerations

- Automate certificate rotation and hot reload in a future release; the MVP documents restart-based renewal only.
- Expand observability hooks so HTTPS listener metrics/log counters stay in parity with the HTTP path once infrastructure is ready.
- Evaluate mutual TLS or client-certificate authentication for the admin API if operators request stronger auth beyond PAT + HTTPS.
