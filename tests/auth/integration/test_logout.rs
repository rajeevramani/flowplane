/// Tests:
/// 1. Successful logout with valid session
/// 2. Logout without session returns unauthorized
/// 3. Logout with invalid session returns unauthorized
/// 4. Session is revoked after logout (subsequent requests fail)

// Note: This is a placeholder for integration tests.
// The logout endpoint has been implemented and can be tested manually or with e2e tests.
// Integration tests would require more complex setup with cookie handling.
