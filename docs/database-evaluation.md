# Database Evaluation: SQLite vs PostgreSQL for Flowplane

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Evaluation Complete
**Recommendation**: **Continue with SQLite for v0.0.2, Plan PostgreSQL Support for v0.1.0**

---

## Executive Summary

Flowplane currently uses SQLite as its embedded database with dual-database support already implemented in the codebase. This evaluation assesses whether migration to PostgreSQL is necessary for production deployments.

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ SQLite is **well-suited** for Flowplane's current use case as a control plane
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL support is **already included** in dependencies (sqlx with postgres feature)
- ‚úÖ Database abstraction layer supports **both databases** without code changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration complexity is **low** due to standard SQL usage
- üìä Performance characteristics favor SQLite for single-instance deployments

---

## Current State Analysis

### SQLite Usage Patterns

**Architecture**:
- Connection Pool: `Pool<Sqlite>` with configurable size (default: 10 connections)
- WAL Mode: Enabled for better concurrent read/write performance
- Busy Timeout: 5 seconds to handle lock contention
- Transaction Support: Used in token repository for atomic operations

**Schema Statistics**:
- **Total Migrations**: 13 SQL files
- **Tables**: 8 core tables (clusters, routes, listeners, api_definitions, api_routes, audit_log, personal_access_tokens, configuration_versions)
- **Lines of Repository Code**: ~2,462 lines
- **Total Files Referencing SQLite**: 80+ (including tests and docs)

**Database Operations**:
- Primarily read-heavy workload (xDS snapshots, API definitions)
- Infrequent writes (configuration updates, audit logs)
- Simple transactions (mostly single-table operations)
- No complex joins or aggregations in hot path

## Performance Characteristics

### SQLite Strengths for Flowplane

| Characteristic | SQLite | Benefit for Flowplane |
|---|---|---|
| **Latency** | 0.01-0.1ms | Faster than network round-trip to PostgreSQL (1-5ms) |
| **Read Concurrency** | Excellent with WAL mode | Control plane is read-heavy (xDS snapshots) |
| **Write Throughput** | ~50-100 writes/sec | More than sufficient for configuration updates |
| **Memory Footprint** | ~1-5MB | Minimal overhead for control plane |
| **Deployment** | Zero external dependencies | Simplifies single-instance deployments |

### PostgreSQL Strengths (When Needed)

| Characteristic | PostgreSQL | When It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Concurrent Writes** | Excellent (MVCC) | Multiple control plane instances writing simultaneously |
| **Complex Queries** | Superior query planner | Advanced analytics, reporting dashboards |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Read replicas | High-availability setups with failover |
| **Enterprise Features** | Extensive (replication, partitioning) | Multi-region deployments |

---

## Scalability Assessment

### Current Flowplane Workload

**Typical Control Plane Scenario**:
```
- Envoy proxies: 100-1000 instances
- Configuration updates: 1-10 per minute
- xDS snapshot fetches: 100-1000 per minute (cached)
- Audit log writes: 10-100 per minute
- Token validations: 100-1000 per minute (cached)
```

**SQLite Capacity**:
- Read throughput: **100,000+ reads/sec** (with proper indexing)
- Write throughput: **50-100 writes/sec** (serialized writes)
- Database size: Handles **100GB+** efficiently
- Concurrent connections: **10-20** sufficient for single control plane instance

**Verdict**: SQLite can comfortably handle **10x current expected load** for single-instance deployments.

### When PostgreSQL Becomes Necessary

PostgreSQL should be considered when:

1. **Multiple Control Plane Instances**: Active-active HA setup with concurrent writes
2. **Complex Analytics**: Real-time dashboards querying configuration history
3. **Multi-Tenancy at Scale**: 1000+ teams with complex RBAC queries
4. **Geographical Distribution**: Multi-region deployments requiring replication
5. **Compliance Requirements**: Enterprise audit log retention with replication

**Current Status**: None of these requirements are present in v0.0.2 scope.

## Migration Complexity Analysis

### Code Changes Required

**Minimal Changes Needed**:
- ‚úÖ Database URL configuration: Change `sqlite://` to `postgresql://`
- ‚úÖ Connection pool: Already abstracted (`DbPool` type alias)
- ‚úÖ Queries: All use SQLx macros, database-agnostic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Migrations: Minor updates for boolean types (INTEGER ‚Üí BOOLEAN)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing: Verify all migrations work on PostgreSQL

**Lines of Code Impact**: <50 lines (mostly configuration and tests)

### Migration File Compatibility

**Current Migrations (13 files)**:
```sql
-- Example: 95% compatible
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS clusters (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- PostgreSQL: Compatible
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,     -- PostgreSQL: Compatible
    configuration TEXT NOT NULL,   -- PostgreSQL: Compatible
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- PostgreSQL: Compatible
    listener_isolation INTEGER,    -- PostgreSQL: Change to BOOLEAN
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL   -- PostgreSQL: Change to TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Required Changes**:
- Replace `INTEGER` boolean columns with `BOOLEAN`
- Replace `DATETIME` with `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`
- Update SQLite-specific pragmas (e.g., `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`)

**Estimated Effort**: 4-8 hours to update and test all migrations

## Operational Considerations

### SQLite Operational Model

**Advantages**:
- **Zero External Dependencies**: No separate database server to manage
- **Backup**: Simple file copy (`cp flowplane.db flowplane.db.backup`)
- **Disaster Recovery**: Restore is instant (copy file back)
- **Monitoring**: Standard filesystem monitoring
- **Upgrades**: No database server version compatibility issues

**Disadvantages**:
- **High Availability**: Requires shared filesystem (NFS, EBS) for multi-instance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Read-only replicas require external tooling (Litestream)
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Requires WAL archiving setup
- **Connection Pooling**: Limited to single process

### PostgreSQL Operational Model

**Advantages**:
- **Native HA**: Built-in replication, automatic failover
- **Backup Tools**: pg_dump, pg_basebackup, PITR
- **Monitoring**: Rich ecosystem (pgAdmin, DataDog, Prometheus exporters)
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer for connection management
- **Multi-Instance**: Natural fit for active-active control planes

**Disadvantages**:
- **Operational Complexity**: Requires DBA knowledge or managed service
- **Cost**: Managed PostgreSQL (RDS, Cloud SQL) adds $50-500/month
- **Latency**: Network round-trips add 1-5ms per query
- **Resource Usage**: PostgreSQL requires 100-500MB RAM minimum

## Conclusion

**Current Recommendation**: **Stick with SQLite for v0.0.2**

SQLite is the optimal choice for Flowplane's current architecture as a single-instance control plane. It provides:
- **Superior latency** (10-100x faster than PostgreSQL for local queries)
- **Operational simplicity** (zero external dependencies)
- **Sufficient scalability** (handles 10x expected load)
- **Lower costs** (no managed database service fees)

PostgreSQL should be added as an **optional backend in v0.1.0** to support users requiring:
- High-availability multi-instance deployments
- Enterprise compliance and replication
- Complex analytics and reporting dashboards

The codebase is already architected for dual-database support, making this a low-risk, incremental enhancement rather than a disruptive migration.
